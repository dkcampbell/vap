several CMake based projects. A JSON based configuration file is used to change
the behavior of Vim based on the project you're currently working on.

* Configure YouCompleteMe to use a CMake generated code completion database.
* Easily support multiple build targets with CMake.
* Simplifies use of non default compilers
* Convenience commands for running and debugging executables
* Integration with vim-dispatch plugin for asynchronous task
