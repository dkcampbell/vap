INTRODUCTION                                    *VAP*

VAP, or Vim Auto Projects, is a poorly named tool for managing configurations
of C/C++ projects using the CMake build system. VAP, once configured, will
automatically enable Vim to work with out of source builds, provide code
completion information to the YouCompleteMe plugin, and launch builds of a
project asynchronously using the vim-dispatch plugin.
